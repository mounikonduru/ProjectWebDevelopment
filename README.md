<hr>
This is my Personal Portfolio that I had developed for the Introduction to Web Development Project. The website that I developed is fully responsive and I had used various concepts of Web Development such as,

- HTML.

- CSS.

- JAVASCRIPT.

The Link to my website: **[https://mounikonduru.github.io/ProjectWebDevelopment/](https://mounikonduru.github.io/ProjectWebDevelopment/)**

### The Website consists of various sections such as,

# How to run the code

<hr>

#### To run this code in ones own personal commputer there are two methods:

1. One need to clone the current repository to their local system by using the following command _git clone:_ **[git@github.com:mounikonduru/ProjectWebDevelopment.git](git@github.com:mounikonduru/ProjectWebDevelopment.git)**

2. One can download the complete zip file of the project through git can extract it to run the files.

#### The file that has to be selected to run the project is index.html file.

Once the HTML file was opened in the browser the CSS file ans Java Script files will already be linked to the document will be preloaded along with the file.

The Website is completely responsive and will work for all the screen sizes such as

- 414px
- 768px
- 1024px

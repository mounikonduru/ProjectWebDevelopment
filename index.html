            I am currently pursuing masters in computer science at Portland
            State University. I am interested in multiple tracks including
            software engineering, Machine learning, Business management and
            psychology. My personal project is about credit card fraud
            detection. I have done several projects that are linked in the
            below. I love cooking and I also listen to the songs and watch
            movies a lot when I get a free time.

                <p>
                  I worked as a software engineer at Tech Mahindra Company in
                  pune, India. I used to work as a software developer, I used to
                  handle unit testing. As a software developer, its important to
                  ensure that your code is functioning correctly and meets the
                  requirements set out in the project specifications. I
                  supported the production department once your code has been
                  developed and tested. It's time to deploy it to production.

              <p>
                In the project I worked on, I built a database system that can
                handle and store several datasets related to different parts of
                student data. Datasets from departments, student counseling
                services, employees, and students' performance are all included.
                Combining these information the database to help with the
                creation of complex queries and reports that provided insight
                into departmental operations, employee performance, counseling
                services, and student performance. Also, the database may help
                with administrative tasks including managing enrollment,
                scheduling classes, and maintaining student records. Overall,
                this project can help organisations in managing student data
                more effectively, improving decision-making, and raising the
                standard of student services.

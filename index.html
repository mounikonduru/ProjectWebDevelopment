                <p>
                  I worked as a software engineer at Tech Mahindra Company in
                  pune, India. I used to work as a software developer, I used to
                  handle unit testing. As a software developer, its important to
                  ensure that your code is functioning correctly and meets the
                  requirements set out in the project specifications. I
                  supported the production department once your code has been
                  developed and tested. It's time to deploy it to production.
